  <h1>Witness Audio Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 7, 2025 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 7, 2025</p>

  <p>Witness Audio (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) is a mobile application that records audio in a rolling buffer and allows you to export recordings to your device. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. Please read it carefully.</p>
  <p><strong>Contact:</strong> For privacy-related questions or requests, contact us at <strong>info@lybbtech.com</strong>.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Who is responsible for your data?</h2>
  <p>The Witness Audio app is made available by Lybb Tech Inc. For the purposes of this policy, “we” refers to the provider of the Witness Audio application. We are the data controller for the data described below that we process.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2. Information we collect and how we use it</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Audio recordings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> When you use the recording feature, the app records audio from your device’s microphone and stores it in a <strong>rolling buffer</strong> on your device (e.g., up to 2–12 hours, depending on your plan). When you export, the app saves the selected portion as an audio file (e.g., WAV) on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> Audio is <strong>only stored on your device</strong>. We do <strong>not</strong> upload, transmit, or have access to your audio recordings. Recording, buffering, and exporting happen locally. We cannot hear, access, or store your recordings on our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Buffered audio is overwritten as new audio is recorded. Exported files remain on your device until you delete them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Location data</h3>
  <p>We use location only in the following ways, and <strong>only on your device</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Safe Zones:</strong> If you enable Safe Zones, the app uses your location to detect when you enter or leave zones you define, so it can automatically pause or resume recording. This is done on the device; we do not receive or store your Safe Zone locations or your position.</li>
    <li><strong>Evidence packages:</strong> When you export a recording, you may create an “Evidence Package” that includes metadata to help verify the recording (e.g., for legal or authenticity purposes). That metadata can include location samples taken during the recording and at export time, plus device and app information. <strong>This information is saved only in the evidence folder on your device</strong> (e.g., in your Documents or app storage). We do not receive or store this data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your location for advertising or analytics, and we do <strong>not</strong> send your location to our servers.</p>

  <h3>2.3 App usage analytics (optional)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> If you have not opted out, we use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (Google) to collect anonymous, aggregated data about how the app is used—for example, screen views, that recording was started or stopped, that an export was completed, or that certain features (e.g., Safe Zones, schedule) were used. This does <strong>not</strong> include your name, email, audio, or precise location.</li>
    <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> To understand feature usage, improve the app, and fix issues. Data is aggregated and not tied to your identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Your choice:</strong> You can turn off analytics at any time in the app: <strong>Menu → Privacy → “Share app usage analytics”</strong> (turn the switch off). This only affects analytics; crash reporting is separate (see below).</li>
    <li><strong>Third party:</strong> Analytics are processed by Google (Firebase). Their privacy policy applies: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 Crash reports and diagnostics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> We use <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> to collect crash reports and related technical information (e.g., device model, Android version, stack traces) when the app crashes or when we log non-fatal errors. This helps us fix bugs and improve stability.</li>
    <li><strong>What we do not collect in crash reports:</strong> We do <strong>not</strong> include your audio recordings or your location in crash reports. Crash data is technical only.</li>
    <li><strong>Your choice:</strong> Crash reporting is not separately toggleable in the app; it is part of our service to maintain stability. If you do not want any crash data sent, you would need to stop using the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Third party:</strong> Crashlytics is provided by Google. Their privacy policy applies: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.5 Information you give us directly</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Support / bug reports:</strong> If you contact us (e.g., by email to the address in the app for bug reports), we will use the information you provide (such as your email address and message) only to respond to your request. We do not use it for marketing unless you agree.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent and preferences:</strong> When you accept the in-app consent and privacy notice, we store that you have accepted (e.g., in local app preferences). We may record that consent was given in analytics (without identifying you) for compliance and product purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. What we do not collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect your name, email, or contact information except when you voluntarily email us (e.g., for support).</li>
    <li>Sell your personal data to anyone.</li>
    <li>Use your data for advertising or partner ad networks.</li>
    <li>Collect the contents of your recordings or your precise location on our servers.</li>
    <li>Use third-party advertising or tracking SDKs for ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Legal basis for processing (EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>If you are in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We rely on your consent for in-app analytics (when you have left the analytics option on) and for the consent and privacy notice flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We use crash reports and diagnostics to maintain and improve the app’s stability and security, which we consider a legitimate interest. We do not use this data for marketing.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing that is necessary to provide the app (e.g., storing preferences, enabling recording and export) is done to perform our contract with you (providing the app).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may withdraw consent for analytics at any time in the app (Menu → Privacy). Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing before withdrawal.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>On your device:</strong> Audio in the rolling buffer is overwritten over time. Exported files and evidence packages stay on your device until you delete them. We do not control your device storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Firebase Analytics data is subject to Google’s retention and aggregation policies. We do not retain raw analytics data indefinitely on our own systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Retained as long as needed to diagnose and fix issues, in line with Firebase Crashlytics practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Support emails:</strong> We retain support correspondence as long as needed to resolve your request and for a reasonable period for record-keeping.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Sharing and third parties</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We share data only as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google (Firebase):</strong> Analytics and Crashlytics data are processed by Google in accordance with their privacy policy and terms. Google may process data globally. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase terms</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or government request, or to protect our or others’ rights, safety, or property.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If we transfer our business or assets, we may transfer data as part of that transaction, subject to the same privacy commitments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your <strong>audio and location data</strong> are not sent to us or to third parties; they remain on your device (including in exports and evidence packages you create).</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Data security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Audio and location used by the app are processed and stored only on your device.</li>
    <li>We use industry-standard services (Firebase) for analytics and crash reporting, with security measures as described in Google’s policies.</li>
    <li>No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we take reasonable steps to protect the data we process.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data, subject to legal exceptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics:</strong> Turn off “Share app usage analytics” in the app (Menu → Privacy).</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> In some jurisdictions, request a portable copy of your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Object or restrict processing:</strong> In some jurisdictions, object to or ask for restriction of certain processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> Where we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time (e.g., by disabling analytics in the app).</li>
    <li><strong>Complain:</strong> Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <strong>carter.lybbert@lybbtech.com</strong>. We will respond within a reasonable time and in line with applicable law. Note: we do not have access to your recordings or location; those stay on your device. For data held by Google (e.g., Firebase), you may also need to use Google’s tools and policies.</p>
  <p><strong>California residents:</strong> We do not sell personal information as defined under the CCPA. We may “share” or “disclose” information for analytics/crash reporting as described above; you can opt out of analytics in the app.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>9. Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed at children under 13 (or higher age where required). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, please contact us and we will delete it as required by law.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
  <p>If you are outside the United States, your data (e.g., analytics and crash data sent to Firebase) may be transferred to and processed in the United States or other countries where Google operates. We rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent mechanisms) where required by law.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy at the same URL (e.g., in the app and on our privacy policy page) and update the “Last updated” date. For material changes, we may notify you in the app or by email if we have your contact details. Continued use of the app after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
