What is Witness Audio?
Witness Audio continuously records audio in the background, keeping up to the last 12 hours. As new audio is recorded, the oldest portions are automatically overwritten. If something important happens, you can export any portion of the recording to save it permanently on your device.\n\n
Witness Audio is designed to keep your recordings private. Here\'s how we handle your data.\n\n
<b>Audio Recordings</b>\n
• Audio is recorded only when you press Start\n
• Recordings are stored in a rolling buffer on your device (up to 12 hours)\n
• Older audio is automatically overwritten\n
• Your audio is never uploaded to any server\n\n
<b>Location Data</b>\n
We collect location data in two situations:\n\n
1. Safe Zones: Safe Zones are areas you define where you do not want to record audio. When you enter a Safe Zone, recording automatically stops. When you leave a Safe Zone, recording automatically resumes. If you enable this feature, the app checks your location periodically to detect when you enter or leave these zones.\n\n
2. Evidence Packages: When you export audio, two things are saved to your device: your audio file and an Evidence Package. An Evidence Package is a folder containing information that helps prove your recording is authentic if it ever needs to be verified by law enforcement or in legal proceedings. This includes your location during recording, your phone model, and other details. This information stays on your device and is never sent anywhere.\n\n
<b>Exported Files</b>\n
• Exported recordings and Evidence Packages are saved to your device\'s Documents folder\n
• These files remain until you delete them\n
• Exported files are not automatically backed up to cloud services\n\n
<b>What We Do Not Collect</b>\n
• Your name, email, or contact information\n
• Usage analytics or advertising data\n
• We have no ads, trackers, or third-party analytics\n\n
Important: As the developer, we have no access to any of your data. Your audio recordings, location data, and all other information stay entirely on your device. We cannot see, access, or retrieve any of your recordings or personal information.
